It is believed that every living organism has evolved from the common ancestor and this theory motivates us to calculate point mutations which are nothing but the changes occur on a sepecific base of a DNA belonging a species. Here, this program aims to detect most commonly occured nucleotide base for a specific nucleotide over different DNA strings and to record for each nucleotide.  Furthermore, it produces the consensus string which contains only the commonly occured nucleotide bases for each nucleotide of interest.
